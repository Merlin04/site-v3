I'm particularly interested in <H>human-computer interaction</H> and <H>systems design/programming</H>. I want to build things to improve the ways we develop software and interact with computers more broadly.

In the fall, I'll be a second-year CS major at <H>Reed College</H> in Portland, OR.

I have <H>5 years</H> of experience working at companies in the tech industry (and trying my hand at starting my own!). I've built technically interesting projects and solved important problems - some of the work I'm most proud of has been

<div class="side-line before:bg-accent-blue prose-li:marker:text-accent-blue prose-a:text-accent-lightblue">
- building awesome programs and projects that let high schoolers discover the <H class="bg-accent-blue text-background">joy of coding</H> and hardware hacking, at [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com)
- automating complex <H class="bg-accent-blue text-background">image processing</H> workflows entirely in-browser, at [Gigantic](https://itsgigantic.com)
- co-founding and building a <H class="bg-accent-blue text-background">visual programming</H> environment to make machine learning more accessible to everyone, at [Kobra](https://kobra.dev) <sup>(#3 on HN and featured in Product Hunt's newsletter!)</sup>
- researching and designing the hardware/software of an open source <H class="bg-accent-blue text-background">COVID ventilator</H> for low-resource communities <sup>(buildable in a few hours with a few hundred dollars and a smartphone)</sup>, at [Kernel Labs](https://kernellabs.io)
- prototyping a <H class="bg-accent-blue text-background">self-driving robot</H>, also at [Kernel Labs](https://kernellabs.io)
