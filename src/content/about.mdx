<b>I do coding, hardware hacking, music, prototyping, fire spinning, and other forms of <H>creative making</H>.</b>

I'm particularly interested in <H>human-computer interaction</H> and <H>systems design/programming</H>. I want to build things to improve how we develop systems and interact with computers and sound more broadly.

I'm currently a second-year CS major (and possibly music minor?) at <H>Reed College</H> in Portland, OR.

I have <H>{Math.round((Date.now() - new Date("November 2018")) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365))} years</H> of experience working at companies in the tech industry (and trying my hand at starting my own!), and I've been working on [my own projects](#projects) for even longer. I've built technically interesting projects and solved important problems - some of the work I'm most proud of has been

<div class="side-line before:bg-accent-blue prose-li:marker:text-accent-blue prose-a:text-accent-lightblue">
- building awesome programs and projects (like [Blot](https://blot.hackclub.dev)) that let high schoolers discover the <BH>joy of coding</BH>, hardware hacking, and digital fabrication, at [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com)
- automating complex <BH>image processing</BH> workflows entirely in-browser, at [Gigantic](https://itsgigantic.com)
- co-founding and building a <BH>visual programming</BH> environment to make machine learning more accessible to everyone, at [Kobra](https://web.archive.org/web/20230729064150/https://kobra.dev/) <sup>(#3 on HN and featured in Product Hunt's newsletter!)</sup>
- researching and designing the hardware/software of an open source <BH>COVID ventilator</BH> for low-resource communities <sup>(buildable in a few hours with a few hundred dollars and a smartphone)</sup>, at [Kernel Labs](https://kernellabs.io)
- prototyping a <BH>self-driving robot</BH>, also at [Kernel Labs](https://kernellabs.io)

## projects!

I've worked on way too many things to list all of them here (most should be on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Merlin04?tab=repositories)), so here's a selection of some of what I'm doing right now + some of my favorites from the past:

<div class="nested-ul side-line before:bg-accent-blue prose-li:marker:text-accent-blue prose-a:text-accent-lightblue">
- [Reed Commons menu](https://menu.enby.land), a nice lightweight site to view the menu and hours of the Reed dining hall (written entirely in OCaml)
- [amonitor](https://github.com/Merlin04/amonitor), a pretty Arduino serial monitor written in OCaml
- a currently-unnamed [isomorphic midi keyboard/synthesizer](https://queer.party/@m04/111010960366493429) (very WIP source code [here](https://github.com/Merlin04/synth-fw), more details hopefully soon)
- [Obl.ong](https://obl.ong), a nonprofit that provides free subdomains with an easy-to-use management dashboard to everyone
- [truthtabl.es](https://truthtabl.es), a truth table generator, (basic) proof builder, and more - uses a parser built with Ohm to implement all the logic from scratch!
- [Niue](https://github.com/Merlin04/niue), a tiny shared state and event library for React [(and plain JS!)](https://github.com/Merlin04/tahitiensis)
- contributed to the Spotify Car Thing hacking scene by making a working/buildable [reconstruction of the TypeScript source](https://github.com/Merlin04/superbird-webapp) of the frontend webapp, making it possible to add features to the original UI
    - someone used it as the basis of a [Mandarin translation](https://github.com/NekoLines/Spotify-Car-Thing-Chinese-Webapps)!
- [choc_ergo](https://keypcb.xyz/choc_ergo), an ergonomic keyboard kit with a beautiful PCB that was hand-drawn in a vector graphics editor
- [experimental-type-lang](https://github.com/Merlin04/experimental-type-lang), a weird experimental functional programming language built on the idea of storing all data as unit values and arrays
- developed the plugin system of [Devzat](https://github.com/quackduck/devzat), a popular SSH chat server, as well as a [client library](https://yarnpkg.com/package?name=devzat) and multiple plugins
- [emojibot](https://github.com/Merlin04/emojibot), a Slack emoji uploader bot used by >75 people in Hack Club
- [Reflection editor](https://github.com/Merlin04/reflection), a self-hosting web code editor built to experiment with modern web technologies
