# hi, i'm b<span class="text-0"> </span><a class="text-accent text-0" href="https://en.pronouns.page/@_m04">(they/them)</a>

I build things with computers.

I'm particularly interested in <H>human-computer interaction</H> and <H>systems design/programming</H>. I want to build things to improve the ways we develop software and interact with computers more broadly.

I'm currently a first-year CS major at Reed College in Portland, OR.

I have <H>5 years</H> of experience working at companies in the tech industry (and trying my hand at starting my own!). I've built technically interesting projects and solved important problems - some of the work I'm most proud of has been

- building awesome programs and projects that let high schoolers discover the <H>joy of coding</H> and hardware hacking, at [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com)
- automating complex <H>image processing</H> workflows entirely in-browser, at [Gigantic](https://itsgigantic.com)
- co-founding and building a <H>visual programming</H> environment to make machine learning more accessible to everyone, at [Kobra](https://kobra.dev) <sup>(#3 on HN and featured in Product Hunt's newsletter!)</sup>
- researching and designing the hardware/software of an open source <H>COVID ventilator</H> for low-resource communities <sup>(buildable in a few hours with a few hundred dollars and a smartphone)</sup>, at [Kernel Labs](https://kernellabs.io)
- prototyping a <H>self-driving robot</H>, also at [Kernel Labs](https://kernellabs.io)
